# DS 310: Machine Learning for Data Analytics


## Overview

    
The course teaches students the principles of machine learning (and data mining) and their applications in the data sciences. The course introduces the principles of machine learning (and data mining), representative machine learning algorithms and their applications to real-world problems. Topics to be covered include: principled approaches to clustering, classification, and function approximation from data, feature selection and dimensionality reduction, assessing the performance of alternative models, and relative strengths and weaknesses of alternative approaches. The course will include a laboratory component to provide students with hands-on experience with applications of the algorithms to problems from several domains. Prerequisites for the course include basic proficiency in programming, elementary probability theory and statistics, and discrete mathematics.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.
